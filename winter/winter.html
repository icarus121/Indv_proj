  <p class="w3-center"><em>WINTER</em></p>
  <p>Winter is the coldest season of the year. 
     Days are short and nights are long. 
     Many trees survive by losing their leaves and lying dormant, or inactive, during this chilly season.
     Some animals enter a deep sleep called hibernation to help them save energy and survive winter. 
     Other animals migrate, or move, to warmer regions. 
     People need to heat their homes and wear thicker clothes to keep warm. 
     The freezing winds often bring snow and ice. 
     Winter lasts from December to March in the northern hemisphere, Earth's upper half, 
     and from June to September in the southern hemisphere, Earth's lower half.</p>
