  <p class="w3-center"><em>SUMMER</em></p>
  <p>Summer is the hottest season of the year. 
     The temperature can stay warm, even after the sun has gone down at night. 
     There are plenty of leaves on the trees and lots of plants are in flower. 
     Many trees and other plants produce fruit during summer. 
     People spend time outside, enjoying the long, sunny days. 
     In the northern hemisphere, Earth's upper half, it is summer from June to September. 
     In the southern hemisphere, Earth's lower half, it is summer from December to March.</p>
